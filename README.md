# Creating Users Tupu (Using) To create the user tupu, use the following command: 
         sudo adduser tupu

This will:
1.Create a new user tupu.

2.Automatically create the home directory /home/tupu.

3.Set the default shell to /bin/bash.

4.Prompt for password creation and additional user details.

 # Tupu (Using) To create the user lupu, use the following command:

            sudo useradd -m -d /home/lupu -s /bin/bash -G lupu lupu

This will:

1.Create the user lupu

2.Set the home directory to /home/lupu

3.Assign the default shell /bin/bash

4.Add lupu to the lupu group            

# Set a password for lupu:

            sudo passwd lupu


Hupu (System User) To create a system user hupu with restricted login, use:            

            sudo useradd --system --shell /bin/false hupu

Granting Sudo Privilege Method 1: Using (Recommended) Edit the sudoers file safely:  
                sudo visudo  

Method 2: Adding Users to the Group Alternatively, run:

                sudo usermod -aG sudo tupu
                sudo usermod -aG sudo lupu

Verify with:

            groups tupu
            groups lupu

3.Setting Up Shared directory Step 1: Create the directory

         sudo mkdir /opt/projekti

Step 2: Create and Assign a Group

            sudo groupadd projekti
            sudo usermod -aG projekti tupu
            sudo usermod -aG projekti lupu

Step 3: Set Directory Ownership

            sudo chown :projekti /opt/projekti

Step 4: Set Permissions

            sudo chmod 770 /opt/projekti

Step 5: Ensure New Files Inherit Group Ownership

            sudo chmod g+s /opt/projekti

This ensures that new files in /opt/projekti inherit the projekti group

4.Verification Check user groups:

             groups tupu
             groups lupu

Check directory permissions

            ls -ld /opt/projekti

# Assignment 6 (APT)

# Part 1: Updating & Upgrading Packages

**1. Checking the Installed APT Version**

Execute the following command to check the installed version of APT:
```
apt --version
```
Output:
```
apt 2.7.14 (amd64)
```

**2. Updating the Package List**  
Run the command below to refresh the system's package list:
```
sudo apt update
```
**Output:**
```
Hit:1 http://azure.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble InRelease
Get:2 http://azure.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-updates InRelease [126 kB]
Get:3 http://azure.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-backports InRelease [126 kB]
Get:4 http://azure.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-security InRelease [126 kB]
Get:5 http://azure.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble/universe amd64 Packages [15.0 MB]
Get:6 http://azure.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble/universe Translation-en [5982 kB]
Get:7 http://azure.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble/universe amd64 Components [3871 k

```
**Why is this step important?**  
The `sudo apt update` command is crucial because it updates the systemâ€™s package list by fetching the latest information from configured repositories. This ensures that APT is aware of the most recent versions of software and dependencies, reducing installation issues caused by outdated package lists. It also synchronizes repository data, enabling the system to retrieve security patches, bug fixes, and updates. Running this command before `sudo apt upgrade` ensures all installed packages are updated to their latest versions, enhancing system stability and security.

**3. Upgrading Installed Packages**  
Run:
```
sudo apt upgrade -y
```
**Difference between Update and Upgrade:**  
- `update`: Refreshes the package list without installing any updates.  
- `upgrade`: Installs the latest available versions of installed packages.

**4. Viewing Pending Updates**  
Check for upgradable packages using:
```
apt list --upgradable
```
**Output:**
```
Listing... Done
```

### Part 2: Installing & Managing Packages

**5. Searching for a Package**  
To find an image editing application, run:
```
apt search image editor
```
The chosen package: **GIMP**

**6. Viewing Package Details**  
To get detailed information about GIMP, use:
```
apt show gimp
```
**Dependencies:**  
GIMP requires several dependencies, including `libgimp2.0t64`, `gimp-data`, `graphviz`, `xdg-utils`, `libaa1`, and various libraries like `libbz2-1.0`, `libcairo2`, `libfontconfig1`, `libglib2.0-0`, `libjpeg8`, and `libpng16-16t64`.

**7. Installing the Package**  
Run:
```
sudo apt install gimp -y
```
**Output:**
```
Download-Size: 4680 kB
APT-Manual-Installed: yes
APT-Sources: http://azure.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-updates/universe amd64 Packages
Description: GNU Image Manipulation Program
```

**8. Checking Installed Package Version**  
Execute:
```
apt list --installed | grep gimp
```
**Output:**
```
gimp/noble-updates,now 2.10.36-3ubuntu0.24.04.1 amd64 [installed]
```
Installed version: **2.10.36-3ubuntu0.24.04.1**

### Part 3: Removing & Cleaning Packages

**9. Uninstalling a Package**  
Remove GIMP using:
```
sudo apt remove gimp -y
```
**Output:**
```
The following packages will be REMOVED:
gimp
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 1 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Removing gimp (2.10.36-3ubuntu0.24.04.1)...
Processing triggers for man-db (2.12.0-4build2)...
```
Yes, the package has been successfully removed.

**10. Removing Configuration Files**  
To remove GIMP along with its configuration files:
```
sudo apt purge gimp -y
```
**Difference Between Remove and Purge:**  
- `remove`: Uninstalls the package while retaining configuration files.
- `purge`: Uninstalls the package and deletes all configuration files.

**11. Cleaning Up Dependencies**  
Run:
```
sudo apt autoremove -y
```
**Why is this important?**  
The `sudo apt autoremove` command removes unnecessary dependencies that are no longer required, freeing up disk space and improving system performance.

**12. Clearing Downloaded Package Files**  
Execute:
```
sudo apt clean
```
**Purpose:**  
This command clears cached package files from the system without affecting installed software, helping to free up disk space.

### Part 4: Managing Repositories & Troubleshooting

**13. Listing All APT Repositories**  
Run:
```
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
```
**Observations:**  
This file does not contain active repositories but serves as a reference, as Ubuntu now manages repositories in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources` using the `deb822` format.

**14. Adding a New Repository**  
To add the **universe** repository:
```
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt update
```
**Packages in the Universe Repository:**  
This repository contains community-supported packages, including open-source software, third-party tools, multimedia software, games, and utilities. These packages are maintained by the community rather than Canonical and may not receive official support.

**15. Simulating an Installation Failure**  
Attempt to install a non-existent package:
```
sudo apt install fakepackage
```
**Output:**
```
E: Unable to locate package fakepackage
```
**Troubleshooting:**  
- Verify that the package name is spelled correctly.
- Run `sudo apt update` to refresh the package list.
- Check enabled repositories using `cat /etc/apt/sources.list`.
- Use `apt search fakepackage` to see if the package exists.
- If unavailable, consider adding a PPA or using an alternative installation method.

### Bonus Challenge (Optional)

**Holding & Unholding a Package**  
Prevent automatic updates for GIMP:
```
sudo apt-mark hold gimp
```
To allow updates again:
```
sudo apt-mark unhold gimp
```
**Why Hold a Package?**  
Holding a package prevents automatic updates, which is useful if an update may introduce bugs, break compatibility, or affect system stability. This ensures control over software versions for a more stable setup.

# Assignment 7: Linux Virtualization
## Part 1: Virtualization Concepts
Virtualization

The process of creating a virtual version of something, such as hardware, storage, or network resources.

Hypervisor

Software that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs). Examples include KVM, VMware, and Hyper-V.

Virtual Machines (VMs)

Emulations of physical computers that run their own operating systems.

Containers

Lightweight, isolated environments that share the host OS kernel but have their own file systems and libraries.
### **VMs vs Containers**

- The difference between VMs and Containers in terms of Architecture, Resource Utilization and Isolation

| **Aspect**    | **VMs**                                          | **Containers**    |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Architecture**     | Requires a full OS for each instance            | Shares the host OS kernel      |
| **Resource Utilization** | Requires more resources                        | More lightweight and efficient   |
| **Isolation**        | Provides strong isolation since each VM has its own OS | Provides a lower level of isolation, as it shares the host OS kernel |

 

## Part 2: Multipass Implementation

### Installation

```bash
sudo snap install multipass
```

![alt text](<Screenshot 2025-03-27 104912.png>)

6.Create a new folder and Mount the folder inside a VM:

```bash
mkdir ~/multipass_shared
multipass mount ~/multipass_shared basyal-vm:/mnt/shared
```
![alt text](image-10.png)

I create a txt file inside multipass folder to share it in VM because without creating a file I can't mount the folder.

```bash
echo "Hello, World!" > ~/multipass_shared/testfile.txt
```
![alt text](image-11.png)

Check the mounted folder inside the VM:
```bash
multipass shell ajit-vm
ls /mnt/shared
```
